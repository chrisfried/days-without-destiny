# Days Without Destiny
[dayswithoutdestiny.com](http://dayswithoutdestiny.com/)

A slapdash little web app that displays how many days a user has gone without playing Destiny.

Built with Node.js, along with some vanilla JavaScript to power the front end.

`routes/index.js` expects a [Bungie API Key](https://www.bungie.net/en/User/API). You won't get far without one. 

[secret-scrubland](https://secret-scrubland-31430.herokuapp.com/) has been broken out into its own, likely equally dormant repo: https://github.com/chrisfried/secret-scrubland
